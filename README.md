# Campus Printing Platform (Frontend)

This is the **frontend application** for the Campus Printing Platform, built with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**. The goal of the platform is to make on-campus printing services more accessible and user-friendly by providing a modern, responsive web interface.

## Why this project?

* Offering a **centralized web interface** for managing print jobs
* Simplifying **document uploads and status tracking**
* Integrating a **modern tech stack** for speed and scalability
* Making the UI accessible across devices using **TailwindCSS** and responsive design principles

---

## What does it do?

The frontend provides:

* **Authentication and routing** with `react-router-dom`
* **Interactive UI components** powered by `React` and `lucide-react` icons
* **Theming and utility styling** using TailwindCSS with `tailwind-merge` and `clsx`
* **Optimized build and dev experience** through Vite
* **Type-safe development** with TypeScript
* **Linting and code quality checks** using ESLint with React, TypeScript, and Refresh plugins
